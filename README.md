# Hello Everyone! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
My name is Elena (Helen), and after many years of working in a job I didnâ€™t love, Iâ€™ve decided itâ€™s time for a change. This wasnâ€™t a spontaneous decisionâ€”it grew slowly out of the realization that my current field never brought me true satisfaction.

As a child, I dreamed of becoming a programmer, and it was Python tutorials on YouTube that reignited that spark. What started as a hobby quickly turned into a deep passion for programming. The more I explored Python, the more I understood that itâ€™s not just a pastimeâ€”itâ€™s something bigger. I realized I want to build my professional life around coding.

Since starting my learning journey in December 2023, Iâ€™ve been actively studying Python and related technologies. Iâ€™m diving into the world of programming with enthusiasm, eager to unlock my potential and discover new opportunities in this exciting field.

Every day, my passion for Python grows stronger, and Iâ€™m ready to pursue it wholeheartedly. My goal is to find professional fulfillment and succeed in this new career path. I believe my determination, experience, and love for learning will help me turn this dream into reality.

## Skills I'm Exploring
Iâ€™ve studied and am familiar with the following technologies, though Iâ€™m still building my practical experience:
- **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, Python OOP, Django, Flask  
- **Data Tools**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Other**: Postman, SQL (is still in progress), Docker (is still in progress), working with third-party APIs, HTTP requests, and the `requests` library  

## Tools I Use
- PyCharm  
- Visual Studio Code  

## My Learning Journey
Unfortunately, I havenâ€™t worked on any real-world projects yet, so Iâ€™d like to share some of the educational projects Iâ€™ve completed during my learning journey:

## My Projects
- [FlaskEmployeeAPI](https://github.com/itprogerspain/FlaskEmployeeAPI) - A simple REST API built with Flask and Docker.  
- [GeminiExercise](https://github.com/itprogerspain/GeminiExercise) - A beginner project to practice Python fundamentals, Git basics, and interacting with third-party APIs for large language models (LLMs).  
- [Aeropuerto](https://github.com/itprogerspain/Aeropuerto) - A Python application that manages the assignment of slots for flights at an airport.  
- More projects in progress!
