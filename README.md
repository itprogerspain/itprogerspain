# Hello Everyone! 👋

## About Me
My name is Elena (Helen), and after many years of searching for something truly meaningful, I discovered a passion that lights me up—programming. As a child, I dreamed of becoming a programmer, and it was Python tutorials on YouTube that reignited that spark. What began as a hobby quickly grew into a deep fascination with coding.

Since starting my learning journey in December 2023, I’ve been actively studying Python and related technologies. The more I explore, the more I realize that programming is not just a pastime—it’s a lifelong pursuit. My goal is to keep learning, creating, and collaborating on personal projects with friends, turning ideas into real solutions and growing together as a team.

Every day, my passion for Python grows stronger, and I’m excited to continue this journey, driven by curiosity, creativity, and the joy of building something meaningful.

## Skills I'm Exploring
I’ve studied and am familiar with the following technologies, though I’m still building my practical experience:
